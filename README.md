- Hardware Requirements:
  - Minimum 8 CPU cores
  - Minimum 16GB RAM
  - Minimum 100GB free disk space
  - SSD recommended for better performance
- Required Services:
  - L1 Execution Client (EL) RPC URL (Sepolia Testnet)

  - Blob Sink URL (optional)

## Installation & Usage

### One-line Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azurezren/Aztec-Auto-Node.git && cd Aztec-Auto-Node && chmod +x aztec.sh && ./aztec.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azurezren/Aztec-Auto-Node.git
   cd Aztec-Auto-Node
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x aztec.sh
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   sudo ./aztec.sh
   ```

## Tutorial: Obtaining RPC URLs

### L1 Execution Client (EL) RPC URL

1. Sign up or log in at [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/)
2. Create a new app:
   - Click "Create App"
   - Select "Ethereum" as the chain
   - Select "Sepolia" as the network
   - Give your app a name (e.g., "Aztec Sequencer")
   - Click "Create App"
3. Once your app is created, click on "View Key"
4. Copy the HTTPS URL, which should look like:
   ```
   https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

### L1 Consensus Client (CL) RPC URL

1. Sign up or log in at [DRPC](https://drpc.org/)
2. Create an API key:
   - Go to the "API Keys" section
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Give your key a name (e.g., "Aztec Sequencer")
   - Select "Sepolia" network
3. Once your key is created, copy the HTTPS URL, which should look like:
   ```
   https://lb.drpc.org/ogrpc?network=sepolia&dkey=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

### Alternative RPC Providers

You can also use other RPC providers such as:

- [Infura](https://infura.io/)
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)
- [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)
- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)

Follow a similar process on these platforms to obtain your RPC URLs for the Sepolia testnet.

## Configuration

The script will prompt you for:

1. **L1 Execution Client RPC URL**
   - This URL should be for the Sepolia testnet
   - Must be HTTPS
   - Should have sufficient rate limits

2. **L1 Consensus Client RPC URL**
   - This URL should be for the Sepolia testnet
   - Must be HTTPS
   - Should support WebSocket connections

3. **Validator Private Key**
   - Must be a 64-character hexadecimal string
   - Can be provided with or without 0x prefix
   - The script will automatically add 0x prefix if missing

4. **Blob Sink URL** (Optional)
   - Used for storing blob data
   - Only required if you want to enable blob storage

## Checking Node Status

After installation, you can check your node's status:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Your node data is stored in the `data` directory created in the same location as the script.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check your Docker installation:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   ```

2. Verify your RPC URLs are correct and working:
   ```bash
   curl -I "YOUR_RPC_URL"
   ```

3. Check Docker logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. Ensure your server has enough resources:
   - At least 8 CPU cores
   - 16GB RAM
   - 100GB free disk space
   - 25 Mbps upload

5. Check firewall settings to ensure the required ports are open:
   - Port 8080 (HTTP)
   - Port 9000 (WebSocket)

## Earning Apprentice Role

To earn the Apprentice Role, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to get your block number and sync proof:

```bash
BLOCK=$(curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"node_getL2Tips","params":[],"id":67}' \
  http://localhost:8080 | jq -r ".result.proven.number")

if [[ -z "$BLOCK" || "$BLOCK" == "null" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Failed to get block number"
else
  echo "‚úÖ Block Number: $BLOCK"
  echo "üîó Sync Proof:"
  curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"node_getArchiveSiblingPath\",\"params\":[\"$BLOCK\",\"$BLOCK\"],\"id\":67}" \
    http://localhost:8080 | jq -r ".result"
fi 
```

2. Copy and paste the following in Discord [Operators | Start Here](https://discord.gg/aztec):

```
/operator start your-address: block-number: proof:
```

**Just replace:**
- `your-address` ‚Üí your operator Ethereum address
- `block-number` ‚Üí the block number shown as ‚úÖ Block Number
- `proof:` ‚Üí the sync proof array shown after üîó Sync Proof:
